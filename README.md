# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

I Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1
Then used the correct element ID for displaying results for Room 1
Added the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set
Corrected the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.
Ensured asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.
Adjusted the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.
Fixed the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets by using the for-of block.
Added the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.

What i learned from this challenge is that, sometimes the code might look correct if you do not pay attention to details, some of the bugs here where too little to can even notice. I found it intresting as it challenged my focus.
